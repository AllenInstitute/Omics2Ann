## About Omics2Ann
Omics data, such as single-cell RNA sequencing data, contains vast amounts of information that can provide insight into biological processes at the cellular level. However, analysis of this data requires the integration of multiple datasets, each containing different types of information, such as expression levels and metadata. The code presented here provides a framework for integrating multiple CSV files containing gene expression and metadata information into an AnnData object, which can be converted into a h5ad file. The h5ad file can then be uploaded onto Cirrocumulus, a web-based platform for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis, for further processing and visualization.

Cirrocumulus provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data and identifying patterns that may not be apparent from individual datasets. It also offers a range of tools for analyzing the data, including clustering, differential gene expression, and pathway analysis. By uploading the h5ad file generated by this code onto Cirrocumulus, users can take advantage of these features to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological processes.

Overall, the integration of multiple datasets and the use of web-based platforms like Cirrocumulus can provide valuable insights into complex biological systems. This can lead to a deeper understanding of the data, identification of novel biological processes, and new research questions that can be pursued. By exploring the data in a comprehensive manner, researchers can gain insights that would have been missed when analyzing individual datasets. This, in turn, can facilitate the generation of new hypotheses and inform future experimental designs. Therefore, the use of this code and Cirrocumulus platform can contribute significantly to the advancement of our understanding of complex biological systems.

## Start Guide
1. Download the files from Github
```bash
https://github.com/beagan-svg/Omics2Ann
```
2. Install the necessary Python packages using Conda
  - Open a terminal and copy packages.yml into a working directory
  - Navigate to the directory containing packages.yml
  - Run the following command to create a new conda environment named pyAnn
```
conda env create -f packages.yml -n pyAnn
```
3. Once the environment is created, activate it by running the following command
```
conda activate pyAnn
```
4. Move create_anndata.py into the working directory 
5. Run the script by running the following command to generate the h5ad file containing the Anndata object and prepare the data for cirrocumulus
```
python3 create_anndata.py -m path/to/mat.csv \
                          -s path/to/samp.dat.csv \
                          -u path/to/umap.coord.csv \ 
                          -o h5ad_filename \
                          --cirro
```
- `mat.csv` represents the expression matrix counts (csv format)
- `samp.dat.csv` represents the metadata file (csv format)
- `umap.cood.csv` represents the file containing the umap coordinates
- `h5ad_filename` specify the exact filename for the generated h5ad file containing the anndata object
- `cirro` is a flag that lets the script know to prepare the data for cirrocumulus
6. `Optionally` to specify data types for the metadata fields. Generate a csv file where first column is the exact field name and the second column is the data type.
* There are several data types you can choose from. See [data_types.csv](https://github.com/beagan-svg/Omics2Ann/blob/main/data_types.csv) as an example

| Terms         | Data Types    |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Age           | str or int    |
| Gender        | str           |
| Height        | float         |
* Once `data_types.csv` have been created, move it to the same directory as create_anndata.py
* Include `-dtype` as an argument when running create_anndata.py by running the following command
```
python3 create_anndata.py --dtypes data_types.csv
```
7. `Optionally` you can change the working directory with the following flag
```
python3 create_anndata.py --setwd /path/to/working_directory
```
This maybe useful if the expression, metadata, and other supplementary files is stored in a designated directory.

8. Follow this page [confluence](http://confluence.corp.alleninstitute.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=BIOIN&title=Cirrocumulus) to upload onto Cirrocumulus
